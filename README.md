## Simple way of generating 230VAC.

2 x 12V 100Ah AGM batteries - connected parallely
1 x INV15 GreenCell Inverter 12VDC -> 230VAC 3000W continuous/6000W surge power inverter

## Results - with two fully charged batteries, 23C room:

 - 3.0 kW-rated heater (measured 2.5kW) no problems over 1min
 - 1.7 Kw-rated kettle (measured 1.6kW) no problem 5 min boiling water
 - Two appliacnes: a fridge and a freezer 14h on one battery; assumed 24-28h on two batteries

 - One battery dies quickly, long 12V wires significantly reduce max power, even if claimed to be 600A tollerant.


## How to get longer?

 - Start a car with 12V acid battery. Once running connect negative then positive wire of AGM batteries. Should run as long as you have fuel (not tested)


## Thoughts/random stuff:

 - DC relays for changing
 - Dont connect AC from battery to grid.!
 - Measuring how much battery is left.
